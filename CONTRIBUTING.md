# Contributing To FGTL2D

:+1::tada: First of all I thank you for the free time to contribute!

I thank you again for the free time you have given to contribute. With your contribution, it is hoped that this project will be better.
Please be able to maintain the language of speech and manners.

## What do I need to know to start contributing to this project?
### C/C++ Programming Language
We need it because it is the programming language we will be using in this project.
And you have to get used to writing comments on the scripts that you write how the code 
you create works so that people who work on it can also find out what's wrong with your 
code and also other people can contribute to the code.

### Fork Repository and Name Branch
If you want to contribute you have to fork the repository to yours, this is because if 
anything happens to your code it will cause fatal problems and moreover github will not 
give you access to write arbitrary code. Surely you finally fork this repository too.
And naming the branch, you have to create a branch with the name: `FGTL2D-<Your Name>-development`. 
First is the name of the project yes it's FGTL2D and your name and the last time with development.

### Documentation writing
If you create something with another name add something you should add it to the documentation 
so as not to burden others. And the documentation branch is in the `github-pages` branch.

### Emoji
Like the statement above you have to create an emoji to tell what you're doing.
And below to show you what emojis are used to tell the code what you're doing.
- :lock: `:lock:` This shows the code that you commit to tighten the code
- :bomb: `:bomb:` This shows the code that you commit to remove or delete the (**code** / **directory**)
- :memo: `:memo:` It shows the code that you commit to notify there are changes or updates to the code
- :shirt: `:shirt:` This shows the code that you committed to notify you of any additions or updates to the documentation
- :bug: `:bug:` This code tells you the commits that were made to let you know how to fix errors or bugs.
- :bangbang: `:bangbang:` This code tells you the commits that were made to let you know what's missing.
- :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` This emoji is to indicate your commit to add a file or example

### Required dependencies
